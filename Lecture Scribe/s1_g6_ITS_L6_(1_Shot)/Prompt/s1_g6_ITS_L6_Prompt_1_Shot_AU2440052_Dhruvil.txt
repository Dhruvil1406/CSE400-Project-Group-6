Prompt:

I want to generate a latex file. The Latex file should have the following content from the pdf "L6_S1_A":
All the definations and notations
Any proofs and derivations in the pdf 
and it should have a detailed summary of the pdf to make the student recall everything for any exam.

I have also attached a Scribe for reference named "group_6_ITS_project_scribe(1).pdf". Your Latex file should follow the format given in this reference file.
