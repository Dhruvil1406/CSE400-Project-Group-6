Generate a complete lecture scribe intended to serve as exam-oriented reference material.Purpose:The scribe must allow a student to fully reconstruct the entire lecture for a closed-notes / reading-based exam, using this document as the sole reference.(Critical):Treat the provided lecture material as complete, ordered, and mandatory.The scribe must cover the lecture from the first instructional slide to the final instructional slide, without stopping early.Do not assume logical stopping points.Every section, subsection, definition, example, derivation, proof, equation, and result that appears anywhere in the provided context must be included.Do not truncate the scribe after any theorem, recap, or example unless the context itself ends.Completeness Rules:Do not summarize or omit material for brevity.Do not skip earlier or later sections even if they appear conceptually independent.All worked examples appearing in the lecture must be written fully, with intermediate steps exactly as presented.If the lecture transitions to new concepts later in the slides, those concepts must also be included.Scope Constraints:Use only the provided context (lecture slides and permitted textbook material).Do not introduce new examples, explanations, intuition, or alternative solution methods.Do not invent missing steps or add external knowledge.Maintain a formal, academic tone suitable for exam revision.Example Lecture Scribe (structure only Ñ do NOT copy content)Topic Title Overview Brief statement describing what the lecture covers. Definitions and Notation Formal definitions and symbols introduced in the lecture. Main Results Statements of theorems, propositions, or key results and make it section wise and add graphs or important figure , table if neccesary Derivations / Proofs Step-by-step derivations or proofs exactly as presented. Worked Examples Example problems solved in class with intermediate steps. Summary Concise recap of key points discussed and important formulas to rememberUsing exactly the same structure as the example above, generate a lecture scribe that exhaustively covers the entire provided context from beginning to end.Follow the lecture order strictly.The output should be complete rather than concise and suitable as sole exam-reference material
